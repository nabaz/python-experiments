'''
Given an array S of n integers,
are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0?
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
The way to think about it is since itâ€™s 3 sum,
thereâ€™s only going to be 3 numbers. So to find the combinations of 3 numbers,
you iterating through the list with the first pointer,
and then trying to find two extra numbers to sum to 0.
Since the list is ordered, the right pointer will always
be higher than the middle pointer. So if the sum is too large, 
you can move the right pointer back one. On the other hand,
if the sum is too small (below 0), then move the middle pointer up one.
